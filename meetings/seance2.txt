Objectives :

* Labeling ambiguous words/expressions within context (finding the meaning)
  -> Finding ambiguous words
  -> Choosing the correct meaning of a word
  -> Finding (easy) expressions (limits ?)
  -> Choosing the correct meaning of an expression (limits ?)
* Webpage / Webapp in text/pdf
* Humor
* Handling harder expressions
* Ambiguity scaling



Steps :

Research : (3 modules)
- Machine learning on natural language processing (NLP), current state of the art
- How to mine data from the Internet ? 
- How to make that data suitable ?
- Which tools should be used for that ?
- Ambiguity
Technical paper :
- List of sources
- List of models
- How to code it ?
Design (Architecture plans,  designer tools) : 
- Which code modules ?
- Adapt to different models
- Make it easy to update

Have everyone look up 2-4 articles on their own, read them and send them to the mailing list (to make sure everyone doesn't read the same thing)
