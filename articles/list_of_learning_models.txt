.deep approach (use knowledge) -> unfeasable

.shallow approach (use surrounding words)
	-> NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifiers (depends on feature extraction)
	-> Decision tree learning (depends on feature extraction)
	-> Support vector machines (depends on feature extraction)
	-> Graph-based approaches
	-> Dictionary based methods
	-> Memory-based learning (depends on feature extraction)
	-> Semi-supervised methods (depends on feature extraction)
	-> Unsupervised techniques (no use of labelled training set)

.feature extraction techniques
	-> Use of bigrams (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N01-1011)
	-> Syntactic features (http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/U04-1001)
	-> Fextor (http://czuk.eu/publications/fextor.pdf) (oups it's in POLISH!)
	-> use of NLTK (python library) (http://www.nltk.org/)
